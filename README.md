#### Auto insurance premium trends
From 2015 to 2019 (the most recent year for available data), the entire auto insurance industry took in $1.1 trillion in premiums, before losses. In 2019, insurers took in a total of $238.7 billion in auto insurance premiums before losses â€” up 27% from the $189.5 billion in combined value in 2015.

During this period, 61% of this value came from liability coverage, including both bodily injury and property damage liability, as well as medical payments coverage, underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage, and more. For comparison, collision premiums accounted for 27% of the combined $1.1 trillion, and comprehensive coverage made up a 13% share.
